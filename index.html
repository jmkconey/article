        Microsoft unveiled a new all-in-one touchscreen desktop computer at its media event in New York today. The Surface Studio is alarmingly thin and objectively beautiful, but its most unique trait is that the whole screen tilts down on a four-point hinge to become a tabletop touchscreen PC. It doesn’t tilt down totally flat, but it sits at about a 20 degree angle, which seems like a natural amount of tilt for drawing, drafting, and swiping things around on the screen. <br> 

        Pricing starts at $2,999. Brawnier options go up to $4,199. The Surface Studio is available for preorders starting today and will ship in “limited quantities for the holidays,” according to Microsoft. <br>
        
        Along with the desktop, there’s a Surface Pen of course, the same one found in the Surface Book and the Surface Pro. There’s also something called Surface Dial, which looks like a sleek little jog wheel. It sits on the desktop and works as a scroll wheel or a jog wheel. But placing it on the screen automatically brings up a context-aware menu. In a drawing app, for example, it will bring up a color picker or a wheel of brush options. A haptic engine inside the Surface Dial makes it feel like a real mechanical piece—a member of the design team says it was modeled after a safe dial, and it feels like that for sure. It runs on two AAA batteries (the swivel base comes off magnetically and those AAAs supposedly last a year) and communicates to the computer via BT LE. The Dial will come with the Surface Studio through December. After that, it’s a $99 add-on.
